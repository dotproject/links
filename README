How to integrate in Projects (subject to change really soon):

!Important!: the following will not be necessary soon. There is a new mechanism for importing tabs in cvs now.


add this tab to the rest. Go to about line 314 and add the following line to the other, similar looking lines:
----> projects/view.php

$showProject = false;
$tabBox->add( "{$dPconfig['root_dir']}/modules/links/index_table", 'Links');
